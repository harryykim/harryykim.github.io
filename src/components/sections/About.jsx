                I am a hardworking, intellectual individual studying Software Systems at Simon Fraser University. I'm interested in software development, and have experience in languages like C++ and Java, and am learning some web design and React.
                As I continue my journey in software development, I'm excited to explore new technologies and their real-world applications.
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and working on creative projects.
